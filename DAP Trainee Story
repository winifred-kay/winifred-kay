####  üõ†Ô∏èMy Azubi Africa Journey üòç

 After graduating my first degree in computer science, I was introduced to a broad world of tech paths I could choose as a
 a career journey. I got confusedüò¢ at a point o what career path to pursue. I gradually drifted to data analytics and how influential it was in business decision recently,
but I did know how to start there journey. So when I came across Azubi Africa, a renowned institution offering data science courses, 
I knew it was the perfect opportunity to enhance my skills and pursue my passion. Little did I know that this journey would prove to be transformative and enriching in ways 
I never imagined.üíØ‚úîÔ∏è‚òëÔ∏è

The program at Azubi Africa was designed in a structured manner to ensure that students gain comprehensive knowledge and practical experience in the field of data science. 
It consisted of two main phases - a three-month theory training followed by a six-month project phase.


During the three-month theory training, we delved into various essential topics and tools related to data science. The curriculum prioritized building a strong foundation and
equipping us with the necessary skills to excel in the field.

We underwent rigorous training in Excel skills, which included data cleaning, formatting, and manipulation techniques. This was followed by an in-depth exploration of SQL,
which is a vital tool used for managing and analyzing large databases.Another significant component of the theory training was learning Power BI. We were taught how to create
visually appealing and interactive dashboards to present data effectively. This tool proved to be invaluable in showcasing insights and patterns to stakeholders in a concise 
and understandable way.

Python for machine learning was the highlight of the theory training. We learned about various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation
methods. Being able to implement these concepts using Python opened up a whole new world of possibilities. We honed our skills in Python programming, focusing on libraries 
such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.


After completing the theory training, we embarked on the project phase, which spanned six months. This phase was a chance for us to apply the knowledge we had gained during
the theory training to real-world projects. Azubi Africa provided us with six diverse and challenging projects that tested our problem-solving abilities üí™ and encouraged us to 
think critically.

The projects covered various aspects of data science, including predictive modeling, natural language processing, and image classification. Each project presented unique 
challenges, allowing us to develop a wide range of skills and gain experience in different domains. Moreover, we had the opportunity to work on projects as part of a team, 
enabling us to enhance our collaboration and communication skills.

Throughout the project phase, we received guidance and support from experienced mentors who provided valuable insights and helped us overcome obstacles. Their expertise and
constant feedback were instrumental in shaping our project outcomes and refining our skills.


In conclusion, my journey as a data science student with Azubi Africa has been an incredible experience.  
I have gained proficiency in essential tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, enabling me to tackle complex data-related challenges.
The project phase allowed me to apply my skills in a practical setting, solving real-world problems and collaborating with a team.
It has provided me with invaluable hands-on experience and prepared me to enter the professional world of data science. 
I am grateful to Azubi Africa ‚ù§Ô∏èüíû for providing me with this opportunity and look forward to embracing new challenges and furthering my growth as a data scientist ‚ú®‚≠êüåü
